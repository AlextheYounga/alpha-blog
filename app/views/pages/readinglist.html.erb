      <p>Probably the best book I&#8217;ve ever read. I read this book right out of high school, and I immediately came to the 
      realization that I had never learned how to treat people. This book changed that, and it&#8217;s impact has lasted the longest.</p>

      <p>Have you ever thought, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m not the first person to go through this whole &#8216;life&#8217; thing; surely somebody has 
      figured out the best way to live one by now&#8230;&#8221; </em>Well, it turns out people have, their works have just been pushed to the 
      back of the  bookshelf for a couple of thousand years. The Romans, through logical argument and thought, concluded the most rational way 
      to live a life, and it can all by found in this book.</p>

      <p>This book helped introduce me to the benefits of having a philosophy of life. I think the best way I can explain the main message of 
      this book is through this quote: <em>&#8220;The man who grasps principles can successfully handle his own methods. The man who tries 
      methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.&#8221; -Ralph Waldo Emerson (attributed).</em></p>

      <p>Henry Hazlitt, I believe was the smartest man of the last two centuries, and despite this, his books are found on very few shelves. 
      Not only was he the true first to truncate the complexities of economics into something the common man could understand 
      <em>(Economics in One Lesson)</em> but he also concured moral philosophy. Hazlitt, using economics, solves the problems moral 
      philosophers have been debating for centuries. </p>

      greatest writer of the last two centures, softens your disappointment of mankind with hilarious wit and beautiful prose. Mencken is 
      a wordsmith. </p>

      <p>I hated &#8216;positive thinking&#8217; my whole life. I never liked the idea of simply forcing yourself to be happy; it never really 
solved anything. This book expands upon the stoic philosophies and explains how you can become happier through &#8216;negative thinking.&#8217;
I promise, it&#8217;s not as morbid as it sounds.</p>

      <p>Charles Koch is the 6th richest man in the world, ($46B),  and he wrote a book called Good Profit. That should have sold it for you. 
      But maybe you need more convincing- after all, how did he get all that money? He could have just robbed  10,623,556 banks. Charles Koch 
      believes the reasoning for his success is because of his successful management system, what he calls Market-Based-Management. He&#8217;s 
      taken the economic works of Ludwig Von Mises and F.A. Hayek and transformed them into a business management system.</p>

      classic recounts the most famous blunders of finance, and although mainstream economists may claim we live in a time where bubbles no
      longer exist, this book unmasks our financial system for nearly the same system that's existed for over 400 years.</p>

      <p>This book surely won't be found on the shelves of the political correct, not because it is untruthful, biased, or crude. It's 
      actually written in a very cautious manner, the author being careful not to make any statements unbacked by science. This book explains 
      the importance of genetics in humans, race, and even recounts the entire history of man. Having read several books on genetics and 
      neuro-science, this is hands-down the best book on the subject. </p>

      that sometimes forces the reader into slumber, but what he lacks for in style he makes up for in sheer knowledge. Cal Newport taught me
      how to be a productive human being, and his teachings have increased my productivity significantly.</p>

      <p>If you haven't taken the Myers Briggs personality test, I recommend taking it. It's not an 8ball of truth, but it can often describe
      your personality in eery detail. Again, it's not perfect, and your personality changes as you age. When I first took it at 17, I was
      an INTJ. I grew out of that though, and I've been an INTP ever since. This book expands upon the potential of that test, explaining 
      what each personality's ideal workplace might be. </p>
